# WonderfulDay - performance visualization app

## What is WonderfulDay?

Wonderful day is intended to boost people’s positive energy by reflecting on all the wonderful things they have done everyday. 
It will:

- Summarize you what you have worked on today
- Ask you if you have done any cool things nobody knows yet

We are doing all kinds of wonderful things every day. However, sometimes, we are so concentrated on the task itself and so forget what we have done in the end of the day.

## What is the goal of this app?

**Problems**

- We spend time writing our monthly reviews, but we often forget what we have worked on a month ago.
- We often feel pressured on not getting things done, or not doing enough, even though we are doing great and outputting so much positive effects
- We do so many wonderful small and big things, but no one ever knows it

Let’s let everyone know, let’s let ourselves know how wonderful we are, how much amazing work we have done!
